NOTES FOR MYSELF:

1.Protobuf was available in anaconda itself, it comes automatically when installing Tensorflow, so I did not 
download or
 manually install it. (i.e you can download and install
protbuf from anaconda-navigator->environments->search for the package under the environement you want).

2. To use protobuf, first activate tf_object_detection api as the protobuf pkg is installed only in this environement.

3.I downloaded and cloned tensorflow/models from github (around 430mb huge file). It was renamed from models-master to models.

4. Object detection is under models/research directory.

5. opencv was installed using pip and not anaconda.

6. This was written in .bashrc file: export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/atulu/Documents/cav_detection_tf_obj_det_api/models/research:/home/atulu/Documents/cav_detection_tf_obj_det_api/models/research/slim

7. SPECIFIC VERSION OF TENSORFLOW AND PYTHON WAS ISNTALLED: TF 1.9.0 along with PTYHON 3.6.10 AS THERE WERE 
COMPATIBILTY ISSUES -> from anaconda navigator itself (i had to downgrade after installing 2.0)

8. INSTALLING LABELIMG - download the github repo zip file from it's github page. Follow the instructions given in their readme file.
 Qt5 and the labelimg stuff were installed in the tf_object_detection environment.
 

	->in labelimg-master directory with tf_object_detection api, lxml wasn't installed as specified in requirements.txt
	  file in the labelimg repo, as  it was already installed in my conda environment. But it is needed to note that labelimg was
	  asking for 4.2.4 version, while I had 4.4.2 version installed.
	-> inside labelimg-master directory, the "make qt5py3" command was done.
	-> python3 labelimg.py command would run the application.






####################
WHILE TRAINING
1.select and download a model from here:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md
EXTRACT IT AND PUT IN THE models/research/object-detection directory


2.select the corresponding sample config file for the downloaded model
it will be there in models/research/object_detection directory itself under some sample directory.

3. I then selected the config file, copied it, and pasted the file to the 
same directory where my extracted-downloaded model was.

4. Now edit the config file: especially the "PATH_TO_BE_CONFIGURED" should be the path
to the downloaded model.

LATER EDIT: NOTE THAT FULL PATH OF THE CONFIG FILES, RECORD FILES NEED TO BE WRITTEN!

Inside train_input_reader:
ALSO, change the input_path, :ours is "data/train.record". (for some reason the
already written line has a "-?????-of-00100" also written. We deleted that part
for now and only let it be "train.record"

In the Output path, we will be having "data/object-detection.pbtxt"
the object-detection.pbtxt file is something we will be creating.

similiarly, inside eval_input_reader:
change to "data/test.record" and "data/object-detection.pbtxt"

5. After this the 'object-detection.pbtxt' file was created, and
for now placed in "training" directory which was also created.

the config file was also moved into the 'training' directory.


6. Now the data, ssd_mobile_net..(whatever model you had), training,
imgs folders needs to be put in the legacy folder, which is where the 
train.py file is. Or you can out them wherever you want, but you 
will have to specify the full path when running train.py in terminal.
THE xml_to_csv.py and generate_tfrecords.py file was copied into the legacy
directory for convenience.


7. NOW GO TO legacy FOLDER, THE training.py file WILL BE THERE:
OPEN IN TERMINAL AND RUN:
python3 train.py --logtostderr --train_dir=training/ --pipeline_config_path=training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coc.config

8. IMPORTANT: 
MAKE SURE YOU GO THROUGH ALL THE SAMPLES IN THE CSV FILE AND CHECK IF THERE ARE ANY
 0 HEIGHT AND 0 WIDTH IMAGES IN YOUR TRAIN OR TEST DATASET.

DELETE THOSE IMAGES AND ALSO MAKE THE CSV FILES AGAIN BY EXECUTING THE xml_to_csv.py AND THEN 
MAKE THE TFRECORD FILES BY RUNNING generate_tfrecords.py.


##############################################################################

9. YOU CAN ALSO FOLLOW THIS TUTORIAL FOR UNDERSTANDING THE PORPER DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html

10. IMPORTANT: USE model_train.py FILE, THE train.py FILE SEEMS TO ENCOUNTER SOME KIND OF OOM
ERROR OR SOMETHING, WHICH JUST DID NOT WORK FOR MY CASE.
THE COMMAND I ENTERED:
python3 /content/drive/My\ Drive/cav_detection_tf_obj_det_api/models/research/object_detection/model_main.py --model_dir=/content/drive/My\ Drive/cav_detection_tf_obj_det_api/models/research/object_detection/legacy/training --pipeline_config_path=/content/drive/My\ Drive/cav_detection_tf_obj_det_api/models/research/object_detection/legacy/training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config

11. WE CHNAGED THE MODEL DIRECTORY COMPLETELY: WE CREATED A my_custom_detector DIR UNDER THE ROOT DIR. WE MOVED THE 
data, training, images (imgs renamed to images), downloaded model, xml_to_csv.py, generate_tfrecord.py and also a
copy of main_model.py to this directory.

THIS IS NOW OUR MAIN WORKING DIRECTORY.

12. TO EXPORT THE INFERENCE GRAPH, WE COPIED THE export_inference_graph.py TO THIS FOLDER.
RUN THIS COMMAND TO GET THE INFERENCE GRAPH (SELECT THE BEST CKPT):
python export_inference_graph.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path training/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco.config --trained_checkpoint_prefix training/model.ckpt-<step_num> --output_directory trained-inference-graphs/cavity_inference_graph_v1.pb

13. FOR GETTING TENSORBOARD FOR THE TRAINED MODEL, use the following model (for colab):

%cd /content/drive/My Drive/cav_detection_tf_obj_det_api/my_custom_detector
%load_ext tensorboard
%tensorboard --logdir training

14.Loss for final step (40000 steps with ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco model): 1.6535192.


############# AFTER TRAINING #####################
15. the output_inference_graph folder is the resultant folder created after running the export_inference_graph.py script.
 It contains the trained graph. We use this for detection.

16. For detection from this trained graph, we are basically only intersted in the frozen_inference_graph.pb which was just
created when we executed the export_inference_graph.py.

17. I USED THE object_detection_tutorial.ipynb's code. Note: the code in that notebook will give certain errors. So I made few
changes to it in order to make it work.

18. For the detection, just place the images to be tested on in the test_image_dir and run the code (the last cell)  I wrote 
in the colab cavity_detection.ipyb
